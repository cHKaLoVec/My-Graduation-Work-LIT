The more I study programming, the more I realize that the project is built wrong, the written code - it's hard to call even bad. 
It's as if it was written by someone who just learned what programming is all about. But in fact it is. 
I will try in my spare time to rework it into normal code. 

 Mistakes:
  - Copying code 
  - Missing access modifiers
  - Incorrect variable names 
  - etc.
